    "I have a problem. I feel like I have to memorize non-fiction books, which causes me to either read slow or avoid reading altogether out of fear of what I am missing. \n",

    "My guess is this stems from seeing 'photographic memory' folks read something once and be able to recite it verbatim. I was always *so jealous* of someone who appeared like they could do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "To (over)compensate for what I feel is a below average memory, I over highlight, take too many notes, and focus on memorizing the smallest of details. This is if I even have the *energy to work this hard* at reading - a lot of the time I will just *avoid reading altogether* out of fear of forgetting details. This is quite sad.\n",

    "I **need a system**; a happy compromise between a thirst for information and the reality of my brain's limitations. My goal is to read non-fiction as leisure - instead of TV, I want to read. But I cannot do this with these memorization shackles tied to the activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add complexity, I find if I don't highlight and take note(s) then I can often *drift off* while reading. I almost need an efficient way to actively synthesize while reading. Objectively, a reading system I could stick to would be something like starring key points, then highlighting a max of like 3 sentences per chapter, and/or writing a max of 3 sentences in the margin? Then at the end having 1-page summary of the whole book, focusing on concepts instead of facts?"
