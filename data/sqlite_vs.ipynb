    "Great question! Yes, this is absolutely a viable and common approach — with some caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why SQLite works well for early development:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero config** — no server to install, just a file\n",
    "2. **Easy to reset** — delete the file and start fresh as your schema evolves\n",
    "3. **Fast iteration** — great for rapid prototyping when you're still figuring out your data model\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch you hit:** SQLite uses file-level locking, so concurrent writes from multiple users/connections will cause those lock errors. It's fundamentally designed for single-writer scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The migration path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that if you use an ORM or query builder (like SQLAlchemy in Python), switching databases can be quite smooth — often just changing a connection string. The ORM abstracts away most database-specific SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some gotchas:\n",
    "- **Type differences** — SQLite is loosely typed; Postgres/MySQL are strict\n",
    "- **Dialect quirks** — some SQL syntax varies between databases\n",
    "- **Missing features** — SQLite lacks things like `ARRAY` types, advanced JSON operators, or certain constraint behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "**My take:** It's a reasonable approach *if* you:\n",
    "1. Use an ORM consistently\n",
    "2. Avoid SQLite-specific features\n",
    "3. Test against your production DB type before deploying\n",

    "Good question! `fastlite` is actually in an interesting middle ground — it's a lightweight wrapper around SQLite that makes working with it more Pythonic, but you're right that it's not a full ORM like SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The tradeoff:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fastlite` keeps things simple and readable, which is great for prototyping\n",
    "- But yes, switching to Postgres/MySQL later would require more rework since you'd need to rewrite queries and potentially restructure how you interact with the database\n",

    "SQLModel is a great choice! It's built on top of SQLAlchemy Core, so you get the database portability benefits while having a cleaner, more modern API. The fact that it uses Pydantic models means you also get data validation built-in, which is really handy for web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For your use case:**\n",

    "SQLModel should work well for the \"start with SQLite, migrate to Postgres later\" approach. You'd just change the connection string when you're ready to move to production, and most things should work smoothly.\n",

    "**One thing to watch:** SQLModel is still younger than SQLAlchemy, so occasionally you might hit edge cases where you need to drop down to SQLAlchemy for more advanced features. But for typical CRUD operations and relationships, it handles the transition between databases well.\n",
