RAG helps by pre-filtering those categories down to just the relevant ones before asking the LLM to pick the best match. This matters because A) it's cheaper, and B) the LLM won't miss the right category when it's not buried in noise. RAG acts as the **smart filter** that gives the LLM a focused shortlist instead of the whole haystack."
