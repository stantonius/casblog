Early stages implementation of my blog using FastHTML within Solveit as
an nbdev project

Because this is deployed with [pla.sh](https://pla.sh/), we had to have
the primary file named `main.py`. I could have just made the primary
notebook `main.py` but that would mean running the
`plash_deploy --force_data` command not in the project root, which
complicated where we put the `/data` directory (used in dev and prod).

Note: right now we are forcing `/data` dir update with each deploy via
`plash_deploy --force_data`. This is a temp solution, as this means we
are keeping the source of truth prod db within solveit.
